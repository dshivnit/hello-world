My name is Shiva Swamy. I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand and am interested in joining the GitHub Community and perhaps become a Hubber if I am successful!

I've had an interest in Techie things since I was a kid. I learned to touch-type at around the age of seven (7) and have been interested in Code, Games and Digi Stuff since!

I am new to GitHub although it doesn't take long for me to get into the swing of things. This is what I intend to do. :) (and also to develop my Programming skills and knowledge - I am currently recapping my Java-sense and will be moving towards Python afterwards. Although I can see that Ruby is required to become a Hubber - so I may very well look at that first!
